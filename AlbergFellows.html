          <h2><em>2009 Inductees:</em></h2>
          <h2><em>Al Lawton</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/Al_Lawton.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Al 
            Lawton took to the water early in life. At fourteen he had saved enough 
            &quot;lawn mowing money&quot; to purchase his first water craft, a 
            gently used thirteen foot Grumman aluminum canoe. An only child, Al 
            was encouraged to explore the rivers and creeks of central and western 
            Kentucky. His paddling took him from the limpid water of Harrods Creek, 
            to the muddy wastes of the Green River, then to the white water of 
            the Red River Gorge. </p>
          <p>As fate would have it young Al found a plan in <u>Boy&#8217;s Life</u> 
            for a lanteen sail rig for a canoe and the fascination with wind and 
            water began. Al carefully collected the materials and set about to 
            build the rig. His mother sewed the sail made from an extra bed sheet. 
            (Remember, this was Kentucky and sailcloth was scarce, if not unheard 
            of.) After some last minute tweaking the &#8220;<em>Owl</em>&#8221; 
            was launched in the Ohio River midst the skeptical looks of a collection 
            of river bank fisherman at Cox&#8217;s Park. Al once remarked that 
            the <em>Owl</em> sailed better down river than up but by hook or by 
            crook he was able to get back to the park for haul out. </p>
          <p>Al and his wife Ruth lived in several different locations within 
            Kentucky but eventually settled in Lexington. Within a few months 
            of their arrival Al heard about a new flood control dam, which had 
            been completed on the Licking River, creating a small but well positioned 
            lake on the edge of the Daniel Boone National Forest. Soon Al joined 
            the local sailing association and purchased his first &#8220;real&#8221; 
            sailboat, a 16&#8217; Celebrity class open daysailer, &#8220;<em>Zephyr</em>&#8221;. 
            The sailing association offered a series of competitive races and 
            Al and Ruth joined in. One spring the association offered a bare boat 
            charter cruise on Chesapeake Bay. Al and Ruth signed up. Ruth recalls 
            she was not sure Al would get in the van when it was time to return 
            home. Within one year of that cruise Al located and purchased his 
            first Cape Dory, a 28&#8217; sloop. After a couple of years spent 
            gunkholing on the Chesapeake and a circumnavigation of the Delmarva 
            Peninsula, Al came to two realizations: one, the CD 28, a worthy vessel 
            indeed, lacked the fuel and water capacity he felt he wanted for the 
            next phase of his sailing career, and two, there was no one to talk 
            to about Cape Dorys -- no company, no owners association. The solution 
            to the first realization came quite unexpectedly at the end of the 
            sailing season when a buyer approached him with an offer too good 
            to refuse. Al spent the winter searching for a replacement boat. By 
            summer <em>SarahGay</em> a 33&#8217; Cape Dory had been acquired and 
            documented and the big adventures were to begin. </p>
          <p>The second realization was less easy to resolve. It took another 
            year or two of complaining until Ruth had had enough and challenged 
            Al by saying &#8220;If it&#8217;s that important why don&#8217;t you 
            organize one&#8221;? The gauntlet was down. Al had to act or stop 
            complaining. He purchased a list of registered CD owners, mailed postcards 
            inviting them to a raft-up on the St. Marys River and the rest is 
            history.</p>
          <p><em>SarahGay</em> has taken Al on numerous passages south via the 
            Intracoastal Waterway to Florida and the Keys, the Bahamas and once 
            as far as the Dominican Republic. To the north there have been passages 
            to Maine and cruises of the New England coast and most recently a 
            passage to Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Maritime Provinces of Canada. 
            The love affair continues.</p>
          <p>After founding our organization, Al served two terms as CDSOA Commodore, 
            and like George Washington, Al believed two terms were enough. He 
            remains a member enjoys keeping in touch through the &#8220;<strong>MASTHEAD</strong>&#8221; 
            and is particularly pleased as new fleets are added. Al always felt 
            that the leaders who succeeded him would accomplish the most in the 
            name of CDSOA. He has not been disappointed. <br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>Walt Bilofsky</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/WBilofsky-at_helm.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Walt 
            created the first Cape Dory owners' web site in 1996. He is the owner/skipper 
            of <em>Golden Phoenix</em>, a Cape Dory 30 flybridge cruiser -- a 
            powerboat -- berthed near his home in Tiburon, California, on San 
            Francisco Bay. Walt, along with Sandy Smith and Mike Fahy, were the 
            founders of the <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/capedory/">California 
            Cape Dory Owners Assn.</a> (CCDOA) in 1994.</p>
          <p>Walt wrote his first computer program in 1960 at the age of 14. He 
            founded <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/">The Software Toolworks</a> 
            in 1980, initially to publish software for Heath/Zenith personal computers. 
            Early products included MYCHESS, The Original Adventure, and the C/80 
            C compiler for CP/M. He was one of the three programmers who created 
            the first versions of The Chessmaster (1986) and Mavis Beacon Teaches 
            Typing (1987), two programs which are still best sellers.</p>
          <p>He retired in 1996 but continued to program. The following year he 
            released the freeware program <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/bilofsky/tidetool/">Tide 
            Tool</a> which computes tides and currents, as well as providing sun 
            and moon data, for the original Palm Pilot and all subsequent Palm 
            devices. Jeff Hawkins, creator of the Palm, sails on San Francisco 
            Bay and has cited Tide Tool as his favorite Palm application.</p>
          <p>Walt holds a Coast Guard Master's license, and amateur and commercial 
            FCC radio operator licenses, including one that qualifies him to be 
            a ship radiotelegraph operator.</p>
          <p>So, with Walt's expertise in boating and computer programming, it's 
            no wonder that in 1996 he created the CCDOA's web site which included 
            the message board and the registry of boats and their owners, and 
            became their webmaster. Shortly afterwards they also hosted a single 
            web page for the CDSOA, which was founded in 1996 by Al Lawton. Walt 
            also created and initially hosted <a href="http://www.tyc.org/">www.tyc.org</a>, 
            the web site for the Tiburon Yacht Club, of which he is a past Commodore 
            and Board member.</p>
          <p>In 2002 the CDSOA took over control of the message board and most 
            of the CCDOA's online resources with Cathy Monaghan becoming webmaster 
            and Walt becoming her assistant. Without Walt, we wouldn't have the 
            single most-used Cape Dory resource on the web today -- the Cape Dory 
            Board -- which has been THE meeting place for all things Cape Dory 
            since 1996.<br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>John Dunn</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/John_OJ_Dunn.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">John 
            Dunn, known to the Cape Dory world as the one and only &#8220;Oswego 
            John&#8221; or simply &#8220;OJ&#8221; was born in the late 1920&#8217;s 
            on the north shore of Long Island. His family owned a small boatyard 
            in Hempstead Harbour and as a kid OJ was in his element in and on 
            the water. The boatyard afforded OJ exposure to all sorts of boats 
            in various stages of repair. </p>
          <p>A water-rat from the beginning, OJ was introduced to the nuances 
            of living in and on the water by his dear Aunt Nellie. She taught 
            him many life lessons over the years. Growing up in the depression 
            years, everything was scarce and nothing was wasted.</p>
          <p>Early on he was exposed to an extensive world of wooden boats and 
            it wasn&#8217;t long before his Aunt Nellie had taught him not only 
            to row but to scull about the harbour in all sorts of small wooden 
            craft. This was a vital tool for a young seaman with no access to 
            a powerboat.</p>
          <p>From the &#8220;ole-timers&#8221; that passed through the boatyard 
            of his youth, OJ learned a building and working knowledge of vessels 
            from skiffs to large masted schooners. Recognizing his keen intelligence 
            they would take the time to tutor him in the use of hand tools and 
            other marine gear. These important associations helped to mold young 
            John into the skilled craftsman he would become. </p>
          <p>A few years into his unofficial apprenticeship he was given a decrepit 
            old Snipe that was cast off for junk. Soon he had her bones bared 
            and was well into her restoration. Helped along by those ole salts, 
            doling out their knowledge like a wee tot of rum, OJ soon had the 
            boat shipshape and ready to sail. However there was one major problem, 
            no one knew how to rig the Snipe. On cue, Aunt Nellie enters to show 
            the boys how to rig the Snipe and soon they were plowing Long Island 
            Sound, all sails flying, rooster tails spewing from the stern with 
            their grins as wide as her beam.</p>
          <p>Early on, in his son&#8217;s life, Mike was given an old Lyman motorboat 
            that was in very sad shape. OJ tackled the rebuild and using some 
            unconventional means, soon had the boat on its way back to a serviceable 
            life. During the reconstruction the old masters would stop by and, 
            while puffing on their pipes, would affectionately make jokes about 
            OJ&#8217;s methods. OJ had the last laugh when the beautifully restored 
            Lyman once again graced the waters of Long Island Sound. Over the 
            years OJ has restored over 70 boats and built quite a few more. His 
            restorative skills are without peer. Many an old wooden or fiberglass 
            boat, given up for lost, is once again motoring or sailing across 
            the waves. </p>
          <p>The years passed quickly and in the early 1980&#8217;s OJ began to 
            get involved in trailerable sailboats which soon led him to the Cape 
            Dory and the nautical equivalent of the love of his life - the Cape 
            Dory Typhoon. It wasn&#8217;t long after discovering Carl Alberg that 
            he bought his first Typhoon and, finding a small flaw, soon had it 
            modified to his perfection. Over the next few years OJ applied his 
            knowledge to more and more Typhoons until he literally became the 
            expert in their maintenance, reconstruction and repair. There are 
            many sailors who are indebted to OJ&#8217;s generosity in expending 
            his time and energy to solve their problem and get their baby back 
            on the water.</p>
          <p>OJ&#8217;s gifted spirit and extensive knowledge of all things nautical 
            prepared him for his next mission as a founding member of the Oswego 
            Maritime Foundation. OMF was started to help young and old experience 
            the joy of sailing and preserve the unique maritime heritage that 
            resides in Oswego, New York. During his tenure, the members have constructed 
            the &#8220;85&#8217; OMF Ontario&#8221; from scratch. Recently christened, 
            the OMF Ontario is the premier sail-training vessel on Lake Ontario.</p>
          <p>In the late 1990&#8217;s OJ became a member of the Cape Dory Sailboat 
            Owners Association and with his first computer he became a valued 
            contributor to the CDSOA message board. OJ has become the &#8220;dean&#8221; 
            of the board and there is certainly none better qualified to advise 
            current and prospective Typhoon owners on the minute details of their 
            beloved little sailing ship. </p>
          <p>John&#8217;s unflagging loyalty to his fellow mariners is legendary. 
            The knowledge he shares with us and the humor and grace he brings 
            to our board is truly an inspiration. The Alberg Fellows committee 
            is proud to honor our friend and fellow Cape Dorian with his election 
            to the highest honor the CDSOA can bestow upon its membership - The 
            Alberg Fellowship. </p>
          <p>John's favorite life lesson is &#8220;if I rest, I rust.&#8221; We 
            say OJ &quot;long may you run&quot;.<br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>David Stump</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/Dave_Stump.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Dave 
            learned to sail on Long Lake while growing up in Michigan. At 17 he 
            enlisted in the US Navy under the &quot;Kiddy Cruise&quot; Program. 
            After Boot Camp and Hospital Corpsman School he was assigned to a 
            Marine &quot;Recon&quot; unit in Vietnam. Upon discharge from the 
            Navy, Dave&#8217;s career was in Health Physics/Radiation Protection. 
            When assignments took him to California, he would rent/live aboard 
            sailboats. </p>
          <p>Fast forward to 1985 when his brother Don purchased a CD30B; Dave 
            would participate and enjoy many cruises and &quot;delivery&quot; 
            sails (each spring the boat was moved from Southport, CT to Westbrook, 
            CT - more wind). During this period Dave came to appreciate the construction 
            and design of our CDs, vowing one day to own (&quot;command&quot;) 
            one himself. And around this time Dave discovered the Patrick O&#8217;Brien 
            nautical adventure series of novels with their 18th century verbiage. 
          </p>
          <p>By January 1998 Dave and Carol were looking for their own Cape Dory. 
            By March they found a well-maintained CD30C owned by Gordon Swift 
            (aka Swifty &#8211; a wooden boat builder) in a field in Exeter, NH. 
            The price was a bit high (~$28K), but, as mentioned, she was in very 
            good shape. As they discussed it over lunch, Carol eventually said 
            &#8220;I think you just bought yourself a boat.&#8221; They returned 
            to the owner, made the deal and shipped her to CT.</p>
          <p>The soon to be re-christened <em>S/V Hanalei</em> became part of 
            their family (although the Renaming Ceremony was to include &quot;virgin 
            urine&quot;, Dave was unable to locate any on the docks in Noank, 
            so he settled on champagne) and a part of Cape Dory history. Dave 
            and Carol, with <em>Hanalei</em>, sailed Long Island, Fishers Island, 
            Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds as well as the forks of Long 
            Island and associated bays and coves.</p>
          <p>From 1998 on, Dave (and <em>Hanalei</em>) was a most notable presence 
            on the Cape Dory Board, occasionally asking questions, often offering 
            advice and almost always speaking with a traditional nautical tongue, 
            to the enjoyment of all! Entries ranged from the building of a dink 
            to maintaining seacocks, from stove black on props to the making of 
            &quot;Hard Tack&quot; and much more.</p>
          <p>In July 2000 Dave, Carol and <em>Hanalei</em> attended the rendezvous 
            at Millstone Harbor/Niantic Bay, CT -- the first event of the newly 
            formed Northeast Fleet of the CDSOA. That fall, after dinner and wine 
            at the Lonesome Dove, and a little arm twisting, Dave joined the CDSOA 
            and the Northeast Fleet (with a pointed notification that he was just 
            a &quot;member&quot;. OK, Dave.</p>
          <p>Dave&#8217;s next contribution to the CDSOA and Cape Dory history 
            came at the first Northeast Fleet Annual Meeting in January 2001. 
            He and Cathy Monaghan, unbeknownst to the Fleet Captain, conspired 
            to give the appropriate nautical/naval &#8220;signals&#8221; for summoning 
            the ship&#8217;s captains to the Fleet Captain&#8217;s quarters -- 
            to the delight of those assembled. As a direct result, Dave was spontaneously 
            elected &quot;Nautical Traditions Officer&quot;. At this meeting we 
            planned a CD race for the summer 2001 activities. As it turned out, 
            Dave won by a wide margin -- hence forth, added after his name on 
            the CD Board, &#8220;CDSOA Number One&quot;.</p>
          <p>Dave was the Chairman of the Northeast Fleet&#8217;s 2002 rendezvous 
            committee, with Watch Hill/Napatree, RI as the port of call. He also 
            had new sails made for the anticipated 2002 Cape Dory Race. But before 
            the event, Dave experienced a debilitating stroke and was unable to 
            attend his perfectly planned rendezvous dinner and celebration, the 
            CD race or any further CDSOA activities. </p>
          <p>Dave now occasionally sails as part of the &quot;<a href="http://www.sailctaccess.org/">Sail 
            Connecticut Access Program</a>&quot;, which is dedicated to providing 
            sailors with disabilities quality time on the water.</p>
          <p>Dave&#8217;s enthusiasm for all things Cape Dory, and subsequently 
            the CDSOA, is extraordinary. His spirit is ever present in the Northeast 
            Fleet.<br>

          <p align="left"><font size="+1">Sharon Kairis and Cathy Monaghan became 
            the newest <em><strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em> honorees at the 
            annual membership meeting in Solomons, Maryland in November 2013.</font></p>
          <h2 align="left"><em>2013 Inductees:</em></h2>
          <h2 align="left"><em>Sharon Kairis</em></h2>
          <p align="left">Sharon and Mike Kairis purchased a boat in 1998, but 
            didn’t know a thing about sailing and wondered – now what? Then CDSOA 
            found us when a good looking guy by the name of Bob Ohler happened 
            by our CD28 the very day we purchased her, the “For Sale” sign still 
            attached. As fate would have it Bob stopped and asked “How much for 
            your boat?” “Oh we just bought her.” Then without missing a beat Bob, 
            with hands on hips and a frown, quipped “You just bought my boat.” 
            Apologetically we offered to let him sail it anytime he wanted if 
            he’d just give us a sailing lesson or two. Better than that, in CDSOA 
            fashion, he invited us to join the CDSOA family. Our sailing adventures 
            had begun!! </p>
          <p align="left">The first time out on ‘<em>Dream Catche</em>r’ (later 
            renamed ‘<em>The Splendid Splinter</em>’ by Mike, after baseball great 
            Ted Williams) was awesome! Sharon still talks about the first time 
            she took the tiller in hand, felt the wind catch the sails and the 
            boat coming alive! She finally understood her grand dad's love of 
            sailing! </p>
          <p align="left">They attended our first CDSOA, Inc. Annual Meeting that 
            November in Solomons, MD! </p>
          <p align="left">Sharon accepted the call to act as CDSOA Secretary in 
            2001 thinking it was a way to pay back everyone that assisted in educating 
            her and Mike about sailing and maintaining their boat. Never thinking 
            she would serve more than 2 years… Little did the Kairises know she 
            was beginning a long tenure of devotion to CDSOA, Inc’s membership 
            and the Board. Working with Commodore John Sill, Vice Commodore Bob 
            Ohler and the Board for the next 2 years, she attended and recorded 
            the Board meeting minutes, embraced the commitment to expand membership 
            and mail out new members’ welcome packets, maintained and updated 
            the membership database and readied the Membership Directory for print. 
            True to form, she reached out to the Board, Fleet Captains, and membership 
            when they didn’t send in an article to the Masthead or missed renewing 
            their membership. She seized the opportunity to encourage members 
            to volunteer and serve their fleets or accept a nomination on the 
            Board. It was also the first year she had an opportunity to be involved 
            with the planning and promotion of the annual meeting and what has 
            turned out to be an annual trek to the Annapolis Sailboat Show and 
            numerous phone calls to vendors and friends of CDSOA to secure donations 
            for ‘Captain’s Welcome Bag’ ‘give-a-ways’ and items for door-prizes 
            from friends and businesses that have supported CDSOA over the years. 
          </p>
          <p align="left">It also presented the opportunity to travel with the 
            Board to meet with Ed Haley and potential members to discuss the formation 
            of the Great Lakes Fleet! </p>
          <p align="left">Sharon was elected Vice Commodore for the 2003 and 2004 
            seasons. There were many others with longer tenure and service to 
            CDSOA and far more experienced sailors for sure! Sharon couldn’t have 
            anticipated a jump from Secretary to Vice Commodore...but fate and 
            circumstances cleared a path leaving her the next in line. She enjoyed 
            working with the Board and membership so once again, when approached 
            about the nomination she agreed to serve if elected. The previous 
            2 years as Secretary turned out to be a solid footing for working 
            with the Commodore, transferring and monitoring the Secretary’s functions, 
            and working with all Board members, Masthead Editor, Chandlery Officer 
            and Fleet Captains to continue expansion of fleets and increasing 
            membership. The Gulf Fleet was added and CDSOA continued to grow under 
            Commodore Ohler’s watch finishing with an increase in membership, 
            the addition of a 5th Fleet and a greatly expanded physical area of 
            coverage. </p>
          <p align="left">Sharon was then elected as Commodore for 2005. Success 
            of previous Commodores, their tutelage along with close associations 
            with Fleet Captains, committee chairs and membership enabled Sharon 
            to hit the ground running with ‘to-do’ and ‘wish lists’ in hand and 
            a solid foundation of support. So with a willing spirit and a multitude 
            of ideas to address the increasing volunteer workloads of Board Members, 
            Treasurer, Secretary, Fleet Captains, Webmasters, Masthead Editor, 
            Chandlery Chair, and membership database, along with the looming needs 
            to update/upgrade technologies to manage tasks and growth over an 
            ever increasing territory were going to be at the forefront of any 
            Board discussions and decisions. </p>
          <p align="left">It was no longer possible to conduct a Board meeting 
            and expect officers, Board members and committee chairs to fly in 
            or drive great distances to Board meetings… Fleets were after all 
            locally focused…so without frequent communications between Fleet Officers, 
            National Board, Officers and Chairs team building and consensus for 
            prioritizing, voting and disseminating information would be time consuming 
            and inefficient… her first decision was to set up teleconferencing 
            that enabled all Board members to join and benefit from every Board 
            discussion without cost or traveling and costing CDSOA less than a 
            tank of gas. No need for minutes because calls were recorded and a 
            CD provided; and callers were provided 15 minutes prior to and after 
            calls to visit, catch-up and exchange info and ideas. Invitations 
            between fleets to attend other fleet events were often extended and 
            new friendships formed. </p>
          <p align="left">After stepping down as Commodore, Sharon remained committed 
            to CDSOA and was always willing and available to provide information 
            on past activities, or be a confidential sounding-board, and “when 
            asked” share her opinions or offered advice; was only required to 
            cast a tie breaking vote on one occasion; has carried proxy votes 
            into Board Meetings when Board Members were unable to attend; and 
            has never hesitated to go down to the Boat Show to collect Captain 
            Bag’s Vendor give-a-ways and brochures, or door prizes for an Annual 
            Meetings or Chesapeake Fleet meeting. Attending wasn’t a prerequisite…she’d 
            meet up with someone and deliver what she had. </p>
          <p align="left">Upon seeing the posting for this year’s (2013) annual 
            meeting, Sharon seized the opportunity to head down to the Annapolis 
            Boat Show to see sailing friends and favorite vendors to collect a 
            few items for Captain Bags… No she wasn’t asked…. Nor did she ask…. 
            It’s just who she is and old habits die hard!!!!! </p>
          <p align="left">Mike pointed out… &quot;I never quite understood her 
            dedication and devotion to ‘volunteering’ that started long before 
            becoming a CDSOA member and the length of her tenure and commitment 
            to CDSOA, Inc. I know she’s enjoyed it and it makes her happy to have 
            shared in its successes over the year, as she’s happiest when she’s 
            doing for others.&quot; </p>

          <h2 align="left"><em>Cathy Monaghan</em></h2>
          <p align="left"><img src="images/AlbergFellows/Cathy_Monaghan.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Catherine 
            Monaghan didn’t sail while growing up in New Jersey. Her father had 
            always wanted a sailboat, as had his father before him. The realization 
            of that dream was not fulfilled though until Cathy and her husband 
            purchased a 32-ft Cape Dory cutter (hull #3) in 1995. With its distinctive 
            tan-bark sails, and its dalmatian boat dog, <em>Realization</em> stood 
            out among all of the other boats on Raritan Bay and at the Northeast 
            Fleet’s Rendezvous. With a berth in Morgan NJ, Cathy and Bruce sailed 
            Realization on her local waters, rarely venturing out of Raritan Bay 
            until 2000, when they sailed through New York Harbor and up Long Island 
            Sound to participate in the first of many summer rendezvous of the 
            Northeast Fleet. </p>
          <p align="left">Cathy’s approach to sailing, and to the selection of 
            a Cape Dory, was to do thorough research. She took lessons on a daysailer 
            on Spruce Run Reservoir, read countless sailing magazines and books, 
            watched sailing videos, attended boat shows, and took increasingly 
            challenging sailing courses. Every boat she sailed or looked at elicited 
            the comment that it “didn’t have ........ like a Cape Dory”, so her 
            husband narrowed their search to Cape Dorys until they found one that 
            was perfect for them. And then Cathy improved it. Cathy researched 
            and installed an upgraded navigation system, added GPS and radar, 
            replaced the autohelm (which involved her crawling around under the 
            cockpit sole), took out all of the removable wood from the saloon 
            to varnish it (3 coats on both sides!), cut holes to increase storage 
            and access, and pulled the shaft and installed a dripless stuffing 
            box. During all this, she wrote about her progress (and her sailing 
            adventures) as a frequent contributor to the Masthead. </p>
          <p align="left">Cathy and her husband were at the formation meeting 
            for the Northeast Fleet and she volunteered to be its first Fleet 
            Secretary, a post she held for 4 years, and was elected as its third 
            Fleet Captain, serving during the 2004 and 2005 seasons. In the early 
            years of the Fleet’s existence, Cathy organized a large portion of 
            the Northeast Fleet’s summer events around her own sailing itinerary. 
            She would exhaustively research ports of call that she wanted to visit, 
            would send up an itinerary, and would include stops along the route 
            for other CDSOA members, who couldn’t participate in the entire cruise, 
            to ‘float in’, thus enabling them to participate in at least a portion 
            of the cruise. Working on her own or with CDSOA members in the locales, 
            she would also arrange for the final night’s dinner as a get-together 
            in a restaurant or as a potluck ashore or on the largest boat. Cathy 
            would have spent the previous winter and spring arranging for nautically 
            themed sponsors to send her giveaway items, which she would then hand 
            out in Captain’s Bags. </p>
          <p align="left">Shortly after the purchase of Realization in 1995, Cathy 
            found both the California Cape Dory Owners Association (CCDOA) and 
            the Lake Michigan Cape Dory Owners Association (LMCDOA) via online 
            searches and immediately joined both. </p>
          <p align="left">In 1998, Cathy started working with Walt Bilofsky, who 
            had established the CCDOA web site. Walt had added a single web page 
            for the CDSOA and Cathy expanded it. Usage of the web site increased 
            dramatically with the growth and expansion of the CDSOA until the 
            original web site was largely focused on the CDSOA, its members, and 
            their messages. In 2002, the CDSOA inherited much of the information 
            that was originally hosted by the CCDOA and Cathy took over as the 
            webmaster with Walt as her assistant. </p>
          <p align="left">Cathy continued to upgrade and update the CDSOA web 
            site throughout the 2000s. With the help of Walt she made improvements 
            to facilitate the message board and the Chandlery and also to provide 
            for greater website security. She was instrumental in an upgrade which 
            switched the old CCDOA-based site over to one totally managed by the 
            CDSOA. When Walt Bilofsky stepped down, Bob Dugan and Ray Garcia stepped 
            up as assistants and when Cathy’s increased sailing time (after she 
            and her husband retired) made it impossible for her to single-handedly 
            oversee the website it is in good hands and she remains as the official 
            webmaster to this date.</p>
          <p align="left">Cathy received the Commodore’s Award in 2003 and she 
            and her husband were awarded the Navigators Award by the CDSOA in 
            2007 for their voyages on <em>Realization</em> and as off-shore crew 
            on other boats. </p>
          <p align="left">One sailor’s wife, reflecting on the amount of time 
            her own husband spent on the CDSOA message board every evening, once 
            asked Cathy if she knew how many men nightly went to sleep happy because 
            of her. Given Cathy’s tireless efforts for the CDSOA and its website, 
            many sailors, male and female alike, should be happy for many years 
            to come. </p>

          <p align="left"><font size="+1">Greg Fuquay</font><font size="+1"> became 
            the newest <em><strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em> honoree at the 
            annual membership meeting in Pensacola, Fl on 31 October 2015.</font>          </p>
          <h2 align="left"><em>2015 Inductee:</em></h2>
          <h2 align="left"><em>Greg Fuquay</em></h2>
          <p>On Saturday morning, April 25,  2015 one hundred and nineteen boats crossed the starting line of the 57th  annual Dauphin Island Race in upper Mobile Bay. The finish line for the  eighteen mile course lies just above the Dauphin Island Bridge near the mouth  of the bay, and racers traditionally continue on to the anchorage behind the  island for an end-of- race party and awards presentation. There would be no  party this year.</p>
          <p>At about 3 PM, as many of the boats  were in the vicinity of the finish line, a violent storm hit the fleet with a  force far above the forecast predictions and well above hurricane strength. Multiple  &ldquo;macrobursts&rdquo; with vertical wind components approaching 100 mph caused numerous  knockdowns and capsizes. Forty of the estimated four hundred and seventy five participating  sailors ended up in the chilly waters and separated from their boats,  tragically, six of them were drowned, their bodies recovered only after a  massive search and rescue effort by the Coast Guard and Marine Patrols.</p>
          <p>Three Cape Dories from the CDSOA  Central Gulf Fleet were entered in the race, including the CD30B &ldquo;<em>Amazing  Grace</em>&rdquo; under the command of the fleet secretary, Greg Fuquay. While most of the  boats were engaged in making efforts to ensure their own survival Greg and his  crew were moving beyond their own concerns. Searching for boats in distress and  survivors in the water Greg and his crew threw all available life jackets and  flotation devices to people he was unable to reach&cedil; and was able to maneuver in  the estimated eight to ten foot seas and hurricane force winds to successfully  pull two exhausted sailors out of the water. He is credited with saving their  lives.</p>
          <p>Greg is a relatively new Cape  Dory sailor. Just two years prior to the 2015 race Greg entered the Dauphin  Island race in his newly acquired CD25, and finished one boat shy of being  presented with the &ldquo;Perseverance Award&rdquo;, given for the last boat to cross the  finish line. Two years of experience have done wonders in making Greg a  competent sailor who understands the oldest tradition of the sea, that no  effort may be spared in bringing relief to those who find themselves in peril  at sea.</p>
          <p>For bringing credit upon himself  and upon the Cape Dory Sailboat Owners Association Greg is hereby recognized by  our highest honor, that of being named an <strong>Alberg  Fellow.</strong>          </p>
