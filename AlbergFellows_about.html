                    <td valign="top">The inspiration for the distinguished group 
                      that will hereafter be known as the &#8220;<strong><em>Alberg 
                      Fellows</em></strong>&#8221; began in July 2008 with Mike 
                      Ritenour and Ed Haley, fittingly as they were making their 
                      way down the Hudson heading for Maine aboard Mike&#8217;s 
                      beloved CD33 La Vida. Mike shared his idea with me and we 
                      in turn shared it with Vice Commodore Leo MacDonald. That 
                      idea was simply to honor, in some way, individuals who have 
                      contributed in a unique and significant way to our organization 
                      and to the preservation of the Cape Dory community. 
                      <p>We discussed the idea with the Board of Directors and 
                        just before Labor Day, Commodore Bud Menchey appointed 
                        a committee - Mike Ritenour, Cathy Monaghan, Jeff Wright, 
                        Ed Haley and myself - to come up with a plan and to select 
                        the charter members. </p>
                      <p>Our committee corresponded through emails and phone calls. 
                        We surveyed veteran members from across the country. On 
                        October 1, the committee approved the following motions 
                        by unanimous consent: </p>
                      <blockquote> 
                        <p>&#8226; that the CDSOA establish a method of recognition 
                          or thanks to members of the CDSOA, Inc. to be known 
                          as the &#8220;<strong><em>Alberg Fellows</em></strong>&#8221; 
                          to recognize extraordinary contributions in support 
                          of the CDSOA and its <a href="index.html">mission</a>;<br>
                          &#8226; that an initial group be selected based on the 
                          recommendation of the committee and the approval of 
                          the Commodore;<br>
                          &#8226; that the <em><strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em> 
                          be recognized via the CDSOA&#8217;s web site and would 
                          include a photo of the inductee and a short biography 
                          with an emphasis on his/her contributions to the CDSOA; 
                          <br>
                          &#8226; that our committee consider, as a separate matter, 
                          how the <em><strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em> will 
                          be administered for all future years;<br>
                          &#8226; to avoid an appearance of conflict, that sitting 
                          board members not be eligible for appointment to the 
                          <em> <strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em>; and<br>
                          &#8226; that the following CDSOA members be inducted 
                          as the initial charter members of the <em><strong>Alberg 
                          Fellows</strong></em>:</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p align="center">Al Lawton<br>
                        Walt Bilofsky<br>
                        John &#8220;OJ&#8221; Dunn<br>
                        Dave Stump</p>
                      <p>On October 6, 2008 our selections were approved by the 
                        Commodore. The <em><strong>Alberg Fellows</strong></em> 
                        concept was presented to the membership at the Annual 
                        Meeting in Texas on November 8th and was approved by those 
                        in attendance. </p>
                      <p>We think each inductee is a pillar upon which our wonderful 
                        organization has been built. Al Lawton is of course the 
                        father of the CDSOA. Walt Bilofsky is the creator of our 
                        message board, the life blood of our organization and 
                        the envy of the sailing world. OJ is the &#8220;Dean&#8221; 
                        of the message board and has helped to make it what it 
                        is today. He is also an expert on Typhoons and has brought 
                        many back to life. Dave Stump&#8217;s early activities 
                        helped to establish the Northeast Fleet. Dave&#8217;s 
                        devotion to his Cape Dory 30 <em>Hanalei</em>, his spirited 
                        participation in CDSOA activities, and his love for his 
                        fellow Cape Dory sailors captures the very spirit of our 
                        organization. </p>
                      <p>I&#8217;d like to thank everyone on the committee for 
                        their hard work and cooperation. </p>
