          <h2><em>2008 Inductees:</em></h2>
          <h2><em>Al Lawton</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/Al_Lawton.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Al 
            Lawton took to the water early in life. At fourteen he had saved enough 
            &quot;lawn mowing money&quot; to purchase his first water craft, a 
            gently used thirteen foot Grumman aluminum canoe. An only child, Al 
            was encouraged to explore the rivers and creeks of central and western 
            Kentucky. His paddling took him from the limpid water of Harrods Creek, 
            to the muddy wastes of the Green River, then to the white water of 
            the Red River Gorge. </p>
          <p>As fate would have it young Al found a plan in <u>Boy&#8217;s Life</u> 
            for a lanteen sail rig for a canoe and the fascination with wind and 
            water began. Al carefully collected the materials and set about to 
            build the rig. His mother sewed the sail made from an extra bed sheet. 
            (Remember, this was Kentucky and sailcloth was scarce, if not unheard 
            of.) After some last minute tweaking the &#8220;<em>Owl</em>&#8221; 
            was launched in the Ohio River midst the skeptical looks of a collection 
            of river bank fisherman at Cox&#8217;s Park. Al once remarked that 
            the <em>Owl</em> sailed better down river than up but by hook or by 
            crook he was able to get back to the park for haul out. </p>
          <p>Al and his wife Ruth lived in several different locations within 
            Kentucky but eventually settled in Lexington. Within a few months 
            of their arrival Al heard about a new flood control dam, which had 
            been completed on the Licking River, creating a small but well positioned 
            lake on the edge of the Daniel Boone National Forest. Soon Al joined 
            the local sailing association and purchased his first &#8220;real&#8221; 
            sailboat, a 16&#8217; Celebrity class open daysailer, &#8220;<em>Zephyr</em>&#8221;. 
            The sailing association offered a series of competitive races and 
            Al and Ruth joined in. One spring the association offered a bare boat 
            charter cruise on Chesapeake Bay. Al and Ruth signed up. Ruth recalls 
            she was not sure Al would get in the van when it was time to return 
            home. Within one year of that cruise Al located and purchased his 
            first Cape Dory, a 28&#8217; sloop. After a couple of years spent 
            gunkholing on the Chesapeake and a circumnavigation of the Delmarva 
            Peninsula, Al came to two realizations: one, the CD 28, a worthy vessel 
            indeed, lacked the fuel and water capacity he felt he wanted for the 
            next phase of his sailing career, and two, there was no one to talk 
            to about Cape Dorys -- no company, no owners association. The solution 
            to the first realization came quite unexpectedly at the end of the 
            sailing season when a buyer approached him with an offer too good 
            to refuse. Al spent the winter searching for a replacement boat. By 
            summer <em>SarahGay</em> a 33&#8217; Cape Dory had been acquired and 
            documented and the big adventures were to begin. </p>
          <p>The second realization was less easy to resolve. It took another 
            year or two of complaining until Ruth had had enough and challenged 
            Al by saying &#8220;If it&#8217;s that important why don&#8217;t you 
            organize one&#8221;? The gauntlet was down. Al had to act or stop 
            complaining. He purchased a list of registered CD owners, mailed postcards 
            inviting them to a raft-up on the St. Marys River and the rest is 
            history.</p>
          <p><em>SarahGay</em> has taken Al on numerous passages south via the 
            Intracoastal Waterway to Florida and the Keys, the Bahamas and once 
            as far as the Dominican Republic. To the north there have been passages 
            to Maine and cruises of the New England coast and most recently a 
            passage to Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Maritime Provinces of Canada. 
            The love affair continues.</p>
          <p>After founding our organization, Al served two terms as CDSOA Commodore, 
            and like George Washington, Al believed two terms were enough. He 
            remains a member enjoys keeping in touch through the &#8220;<strong>MASTHEAD</strong>&#8221; 
            and is particularly pleased as new fleets are added. Al always felt 
            that the leaders who succeeded him would accomplish the most in the 
            name of CDSOA. He has not been disappointed. <br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>Walt Bilofsky</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/WBilofsky-at_helm.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Walt 
            created the first Cape Dory owners' web site in 1996. He is the owner/skipper 
            of <em>Golden Phoenix</em>, a Cape Dory 30 flybridge cruiser -- a 
            powerboat -- berthed near his home in Tiburon, California, on San 
            Francisco Bay. Walt, along with Sandy Smith and Mike Fahy, were the 
            founders of the <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/capedory/">California 
            Cape Dory Owners Assn.</a> (CCDOA) in 1994.</p>
          <p>Walt wrote his first computer program in 1960 at the age of 14. He 
            founded <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/">The Software Toolworks</a> 
            in 1980, initially to publish software for Heath/Zenith personal computers. 
            Early products included MYCHESS, The Original Adventure, and the C/80 
            C compiler for CP/M. He was one of the three programmers who created 
            the first versions of The Chessmaster (1986) and Mavis Beacon Teaches 
            Typing (1987), two programs which are still best sellers.</p>
          <p>He retired in 1996 but continued to program. The following year he 
            released the freeware program <a href="http://www.toolworks.com/bilofsky/tidetool/">Tide 
            Tool</a> which computes tides and currents, as well as providing sun 
            and moon data, for the original Palm Pilot and all subsequent Palm 
            devices. Jeff Hawkins, creator of the Palm, sails on San Francisco 
            Bay and has cited Tide Tool as his favorite Palm application.</p>
          <p>Walt holds a Coast Guard Master's license, and amateur and commercial 
            FCC radio operator licenses, including one that qualifies him to be 
            a ship radiotelegraph operator.</p>
          <p>So, with Walt's expertise in boating and computer programming, it's 
            no wonder that in 1996 he created the CCDOA's web site which included 
            the message board and the registry of boats and their owners, and 
            became their webmaster. Shortly afterwards they also hosted a single 
            web page for the CDSOA, which was founded in 1996 by Al Lawton. Walt 
            also created and initially hosted <a href="http://www.tyc.org/">www.tyc.org</a>, 
            the web site for the Tiburon Yacht Club, of which he is a past Commodore 
            and Board member.</p>
          <p>In 2002 the CDSOA took over control of the message board and most 
            of the CCDOA's online resources with Cathy Monaghan becoming webmaster 
            and Walt becoming her assistant. Without Walt, we wouldn't have the 
            single most-used Cape Dory resource on the web today -- the Cape Dory 
            Board -- which has been THE meeting place for all things Cape Dory 
            since 1996.<br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>John Dunn</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/John_OJ_Dunn.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">John 
            Dunn, known to the Cape Dory world as the one and only &#8220;Oswego 
            John&#8221; or simply &#8220;OJ&#8221; was born in the late 1920&#8217;s 
            on the north shore of Long Island. His family owned a small boatyard 
            in Hempstead Harbour and as a kid OJ was in his element in and on 
            the water. The boatyard afforded OJ exposure to all sorts of boats 
            in various stages of repair. </p>
          <p>A water-rat from the beginning, OJ was introduced to the nuances 
            of living in and on the water by his dear Aunt Nellie. She taught 
            him many life lessons over the years. Growing up in the depression 
            years, everything was scarce and nothing was wasted.</p>
          <p>Early on he was exposed to an extensive world of wooden boats and 
            it wasn&#8217;t long before his Aunt Nellie had taught him not only 
            to row but to scull about the harbour in all sorts of small wooden 
            craft. This was a vital tool for a young seaman with no access to 
            a powerboat.</p>
          <p>From the &#8220;ole-timers&#8221; that passed through the boatyard 
            of his youth, OJ learned a building and working knowledge of vessels 
            from skiffs to large masted schooners. Recognizing his keen intelligence 
            they would take the time to tutor him in the use of hand tools and 
            other marine gear. These important associations helped to mold young 
            John into the skilled craftsman he would become. </p>
          <p>A few years into his unofficial apprenticeship he was given a decrepit 
            old Snipe that was cast off for junk. Soon he had her bones bared 
            and was well into her restoration. Helped along by those ole salts, 
            doling out their knowledge like a wee tot of rum, OJ soon had the 
            boat shipshape and ready to sail. However there was one major problem, 
            no one knew how to rig the Snipe. On cue, Aunt Nellie enters to show 
            the boys how to rig the Snipe and soon they were plowing Long Island 
            Sound, all sails flying, rooster tails spewing from the stern with 
            their grins as wide as her beam.</p>
          <p>Early on, in his son&#8217;s life, Mike was given an old Lyman motorboat 
            that was in very sad shape. OJ tackled the rebuild and using some 
            unconventional means, soon had the boat on its way back to a serviceable 
            life. During the reconstruction the old masters would stop by and, 
            while puffing on their pipes, would affectionately make jokes about 
            OJ&#8217;s methods. OJ had the last laugh when the beautifully restored 
            Lyman once again graced the waters of Long Island Sound. Over the 
            years OJ has restored over 70 boats and built quite a few more. His 
            restorative skills are without peer. Many an old wooden or fiberglass 
            boat, given up for lost, is once again motoring or sailing across 
            the waves. </p>
          <p>The years passed quickly and in the early 1980&#8217;s OJ began to 
            get involved in trailerable sailboats which soon led him to the Cape 
            Dory and the nautical equivalent of the love of his life - the Cape 
            Dory Typhoon. It wasn&#8217;t long after discovering Carl Alberg that 
            he bought his first Typhoon and, finding a small flaw, soon had it 
            modified to his perfection. Over the next few years OJ applied his 
            knowledge to more and more Typhoons until he literally became the 
            expert in their maintenance, reconstruction and repair. There are 
            many sailors who are indebted to OJ&#8217;s generosity in expending 
            his time and energy to solve their problem and get their baby back 
            on the water.</p>
          <p>OJ&#8217;s gifted spirit and extensive knowledge of all things nautical 
            prepared him for his next mission as a founding member of the Oswego 
            Maritime Foundation. OMF was started to help young and old experience 
            the joy of sailing and preserve the unique maritime heritage that 
            resides in Oswego, New York. During his tenure, the members have constructed 
            the &#8220;85&#8217; OMF Ontario&#8221; from scratch. Recently christened, 
            the OMF Ontario is the premier sail-training vessel on Lake Ontario.</p>
          <p>In the late 1990&#8217;s OJ became a member of the Cape Dory Sailboat 
            Owners Association and with his first computer he became a valued 
            contributor to the CDSOA message board. OJ has become the &#8220;dean&#8221; 
            of the board and there is certainly none better qualified to advise 
            current and prospective Typhoon owners on the minute details of their 
            beloved little sailing ship. </p>
          <p>John&#8217;s unflagging loyalty to his fellow mariners is legendary. 
            The knowledge he shares with us and the humor and grace he brings 
            to our board is truly an inspiration. The Alberg Fellows committee 
            is proud to honor our friend and fellow Cape Dorian with his election 
            to the highest honor the CDSOA can bestow upon its membership - The 
            Alberg Fellowship. </p>
          <p>John's favorite life lesson is &#8220;if I rest, I rust.&#8221; We 
            say OJ &quot;long may you run&quot;.<br>
          </p>
          <h2><em>David Stump</em></h2>
          <p><img src="images/AlbergFellows/Dave_Stump.jpg" width="200" border="1" align="left">Dave 
            learned to sail on Long Lake while growing up in Michigan. At 17 he 
            enlisted in the US Navy under the &quot;Kiddy Cruise&quot; Program. 
            After Boot Camp and Hospital Corpsman School he was assigned to a 
            Marine &quot;Recon&quot; unit in Vietnam. Upon discharge from the 
            Navy, Dave&#8217;s career was in Health Physics/Radiation Protection. 
            When assignments took him to California, he would rent/live aboard 
            sailboats. </p>
          <p>Fast forward to 1985 when his brother Don purchased a CD30B; Dave 
            would participate and enjoy many cruises and &quot;delivery&quot; 
            sails (each spring the boat was moved from Southport, CT to Westbrook, 
            CT - more wind). During this period Dave came to appreciate the construction 
            and design of our CDs, vowing one day to own (&quot;command&quot;) 
            one himself. And around this time Dave discovered the Patrick O&#8217;Brien 
            nautical adventure series of novels with their 18th century verbiage. 
          </p>
          <p>By January 1998 Dave and Carol were looking for their own Cape Dory. 
            By March they found a well-maintained CD30C owned by Gordon Swift 
            (aka Swifty &#8211; a wooden boat builder) in a field in Exeter, NH. 
            The price was a bit high (~$28K), but, as mentioned, she was in very 
            good shape. As they discussed it over lunch, Carol eventually said 
            &#8220;I think you just bought yourself a boat.&#8221; They returned 
            to the owner, made the deal and shipped her to CT.</p>
          <p>The soon to be re-christened <em>S/V Hanalei</em> became part of 
            their family (although the Renaming Ceremony was to include &quot;virgin 
            urine&quot;, Dave was unable to locate any on the docks in Noank, 
            so he settled on champagne) and a part of Cape Dory history. Dave 
            and Carol, with <em>Hanalei</em>, sailed Long Island, Fishers Island, 
            Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds as well as the forks of Long 
            Island and associated bays and coves.</p>
          <p>From 1998 on, Dave (and <em>Hanalei</em>) was a most notable presence 
            on the Cape Dory Board, occasionally asking questions, often offering 
            advice and almost always speaking with a traditional nautical tongue, 
            to the enjoyment of all! Entries ranged from the building of a dink 
            to maintaining seacocks, from stove black on props to the making of 
            &quot;Hard Tack&quot; and much more.</p>
          <p>In July 2000 Dave, Carol and <em>Hanalei</em> attended the rendezvous 
            at Millstone Harbor/Niantic Bay, CT -- the first event of the newly 
            formed Northeast Fleet of the CDSOA. That fall, after dinner and wine 
            at the Lonesome Dove, and a little arm twisting, Dave joined the CDSOA 
            and the Northeast Fleet (with a pointed notification that he was just 
            a &quot;member&quot;. OK, Dave.</p>
          <p>Dave&#8217;s next contribution to the CDSOA and Cape Dory history 
            came at the first Northeast Fleet Annual Meeting in January 2001. 
            He and Cathy Monaghan, unbeknownst to the Fleet Captain, conspired 
            to give the appropriate nautical/naval &#8220;signals&#8221; for summoning 
            the ship&#8217;s captains to the Fleet Captain&#8217;s quarters -- 
            to the delight of those assembled. As a direct result, Dave was spontaneously 
            elected &quot;Nautical Traditions Officer&quot;. At this meeting we 
            planned a CD race for the summer 2001 activities. As it turned out, 
            Dave won by a wide margin -- hence forth, added after his name on 
            the CD Board, &#8220;CDSOA Number One&quot;.</p>
          <p>Dave was the Chairman of the Northeast Fleet&#8217;s 2002 rendezvous 
            committee, with Watch Hill/Napatree, RI as the port of call. He also 
            had new sails made for the anticipated 2002 Cape Dory Race. But before 
            the event, Dave experienced a debilitating stroke and was unable to 
            attend his perfectly planned rendezvous dinner and celebration, the 
            CD race or any further CDSOA activities. </p>
          <p>Dave now occasionally sails as part of the &quot;<a href="http://www.sailctaccess.org/">Sail 
            Connecticut Access Program</a>&quot;, which is dedicated to providing 
            sailors with disabilities quality time on the water.</p>
          <p>Dave&#8217;s enthusiasm for all things Cape Dory, and subsequently 
            the CDSOA, is extraordinary. His spirit is ever present in the Northeast 
            Fleet.<br>
