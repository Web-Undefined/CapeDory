            The information below was based on a number of conversations with
            various people, and was correct to the best of my knowledge as of
            August 1995. If you have more accurate or more current information,

        <I>Note: See also the <A href="cdmf97.htm">February 1997 update</A> to
        the information below.</I>
        <P>Founded in 1963, Cape Dory Yachts soon earned a reputation for building
          solid, seaworthy New England sailboats. In the late 70's, they expanded
          into powerboats, starting with a commercial dragger and a lobsterboat,
          then branching out into poweryachts.
        <P><IMG src="images/cdory40.jpg" hspace=12 vspace=5 border=5 height=208 width=294 align=RIGHT> Unfortunately,
          the original Cape Dory Yachts was among the victims of the 1990 recession,
          and the name and most of the molds were sold. Fortunately, there are
          now three boat builders producing boats using those molds. So, while
          a pessimist might say the Cape Dory line has been scattered, a more
          cheerful view is that Cape Dorys have gone from being orphan boats
          to being supported by not one but three manufacturers: Newport Shipyards, <A href="http://www.robinhoodmarinecenter.com/">Robinhood
          Boatbuilders</A>, and Nauset Marine.
        <P>The Cape Dory name and many of the molds were purchased by Newport
          Shipyards in Amityville, N.Y. Newport has delivered at least 4 Cape
          Dory 40 power yachts (photo right, <A href="#weitz">&copy; Allan Weitz</A>),
          most in the Northeast, although one is in Puget Sound. Newport also
          advertises the popular 28 foot powerboat in open, enclosed and flybridge
          configurations. <I>(Newport has reportedly ceased operations; see <A href="cdmf97.htm">update</A>.)</I>
        <P><IMG src="images/robnhood.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=5 border=4 height=563 width=420 align=LEFT>Happily,
          Cape Dory's founder, <A href="#Robinhood">Andy Vavolotis</A>, once
          again owns the molds for his 36 and 40 foot sailboats, and is producing
          the former as the Robinhood 36 (photos left). According to Robinhood
          broker Dave Perry, hull #2 was scheduled for display at the 1995 Newport,
          R.I. boat show. In 1995, Joe Bonitch posted the following report on
          the <A href="news:rec.boats">rec.boats</A> newsgroup:
        <UL>
        "
          After noticing [a] discussion [on rec.boats] about Robinhood Marine
          building boats from the [old] Cape Dory molds, I was quite surprised
          to see the first Robinhood 36 over the weekend. <I>Legacy</I> is actually
          hull #200. The owner told me that Cape Dory built less than 150 36's,
          and Robinhood decided to start numbering theirs at 200.
        </UL>
        <UL>
        "
          <I>Legacy</I> was launched late last week at Sill's marina in Sodus
          Point, N.Y. on Lake Ontario. The hull is navy blue, and the deck is
          white with tan non-skid. She is outfitted in Harken gear, right down
          to the bronze self-tailing winches. Harken attended the sea trials
          in Maine, and provided some gorgeous female crew (according to the
          owner) and took photos to be used in future Harken ads.
        </UL>
        <UL>
        "
          I was standing beside <I>Legacy</I> on the dock when the owner popped
          up and invited my wife and I aboard. She promptly told us to take our
          time looking around and to make sure we didn't miss anything.
        </UL>
        <UL>
        "
          One thing I can safely say about this boat is that it's all business.
          They definitely stuck to the KISS methodology. There is no clutter
          on deck. The only lines led back on the cabin top are the main and
          staysail sheets. Below decks is the same - no clutter, very functional,
          and incredible woodwork."
        </UL>
        Quite a few former Cape Dory molds are now at <A href="#Nauset">Nauset
        Marine</A>, a custom boat builder on Cape Cod. Founded in 1961, Nauset
        is "a family owned business, and we're here for the long run," according
        to Nauset Vice President Dawson Farber.
<P>Nauset builds from these molds under the Nauset C/D name. They have the molds
  for the 30, 33 and 42 foot powerboats, the 30 foot motorsailer, and the 19,
  22 30 and 33 foot sailboats. Since they are a custom yard, they will build
  boats on order only; they have no dealers and their only stock is a couple
  of boats used for boat show display around the Northeast.
<P>Thus far, Nauset has delivered three Nauset 42' Powerboats built from former
  Cape Dory molds. The three were configured as a lobsterboat, a charter fishboat,
  and a custom yacht. In August 1995 they were just starting hull #1 of the 33'
  powerboat, available in three configurations: hardtop cruiser, flybridge, and
  with an extended step-up bridge deck.
<P>In the sail fleet, Nauset is building the 19' and 22' Typhoons.
<P>Dawson had hoped to start his C/D line earlier, but had a "sensational year" with
  the old Nauset line. The line represents about a third of his available styles.
  Over the winter he hopes to begin production of the C/D 30' Motorsailer, as
  well as a 30' single engine version of the 33' powerboat.
<P>Owners of existing Cape Dorys have some hope of support from all these builders.
  Newport provided a letter from an 'old' Cape Dory owner thanking them for furnishing
  some parts. <A href="#Spartan">Spartan Marine</A>, makers of most of the metal
  forgings used on Cape Dorys, is still in business in Robinhood, Maine. And
  Nauset is using different fittings in its new boats, but can duplicate molded
  fiberglass parts if necessary.&nbsp;
<P><A href="http://www.hobbymarine.com/"><strong>Hobby Marine</strong></A> currently
  has the molds for the CD 300 Motorsailer and are building it as the Cape
  300 Motor Sailer. They
